# SIEM Lab

## Objective

The objective of this SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) lab is to provide hands-on experience in monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security events within an IT environment. I learned how to configure a SIEM solution, collect and aggregate log data from various sources, and identify potential security threats through event correlation and analysis. By the end of the lab, I have gained the skills necessary to leverage SIEM tools for threat detection, incident response, and compliance reporting.

### Skills Learned

- Search and Query Language
- Data Ingestion and Parsing
- Splunk Administration
- Alerting and Monitoring
- Knowledge Management
- Data Analysis and Reporting
- Dashboard Creation and Visualization
- Performance optimization
- Incident response and Forensics

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
